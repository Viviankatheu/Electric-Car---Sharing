I am working as a data scientist working for an electric car-sharing service company. I have been tasked to process stations data to understand electric car usage over time.
The main objective for this report is to Identify the most popular hour of the day for picking up a shared electric car (Bluecar) in the city of Paris over the month of April 2018.

Our data mining goals for this project are as listed below:

1. To identify the most popular hour of the day for picking up a shared electric car (Bluecar) in the city of Paris over the month of April 2018.
2. To come up with the most popular hour for returning cars (overall and at the most popular picking hour
3. To get the most popular postal code for picking up blue cars and if the most popular station belongs to that postal code
4. To find out if results change if I consider Utilib and Utilib 1.4 over blue cars
